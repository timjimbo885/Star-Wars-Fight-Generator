    ${b5} eyes, but shouldnâ€™t they be residing on ${b3}?<br> \
    For years, these two warriors have been tested, each one going through their own adventures. 
    <br> They have participated in battles many times, but neither have been in a quarrel quite like this.\n
    <br>Now, they were preparing for their battle, a showdown that would determine who would reign supreme. 
    <br>They both knew that this would be the most challenging fight of their lives, and they were determined to come out on top.
    As they prepared for battle, ${a1} and ${b1} thought back to their childhoods,<br> to the land they had grown up in, 
    and the dreams they had once had.<br> But those days were long gone, replaced by a burning desire to win at any cost.
    Finally, the day of the battle arrived. <br>The two warriors faced each other, their weapons hungered for blood. <br>
    They exchanged a few words, each one trying to intimidate the other. And then, with a fierce determination, 
    they charged at each other.<br>
    For what seemed like hours, they fought tooth and nail, each one landing blow after blow.<br> But in the end, 
    there could only be one winner. And when the dust settled, it was ${a1} who emerged victorious.<br>
    As they drifted away from each other, battered and bruised, ${a1} couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. <br>
    They had always known that this battle would be the end of their rivalry, 
    but they hadn't quite been prepared for what that would mean.
    And so, as they flew off into the galaxy, ${a1}
    knew that they would always remember their deceased opponent,<br> the one who had pushed them to be their very best...
